Increasing utilization of smartphones across the globe backed by the boom in the global population is expected to enlarge the market size over the forecast period. The increasing utilization of smartphones has made it easier for people to access the internet which in turn is anticipated to boost the market growth over the forecast period. For instance, globally it was anticipated that in 2023, there were around 6 billion people were anticipated to be using smartphones which were estimated to increase from 3 billion in 2016. Additionally, the notable penetration of smartphones and the internet has spiked the better provision of telecommunication services among the global population. Telecommunication services are being highly utilized in every sector nowadays. For instance, around USD 1500 billion were anticipated to be spent on telecom services globally.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global 5G base station market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in the Utilization of IoT Devices 
- Rising Penetration of the Internet 

**Challenges:**

Limitations on accessibility in remote or rural areas and major differences in upload and download speed worldwide are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global 5G base station market. Additionally, stringent regulatory protocols are also expected to hamper the market growth over the forecast period. 5G base stations are noticed to consume more power than typical 4G networks. 

By 5G base station type, the global 5G base station market is segmented into small cells and macro cells. The small cells segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Small cell segment is further bifurcated into microcells, femtocells, and picocells. Factors such as, less expensive, upgraded capacity, and convenient installation of small cells are anticipated influence the segment growth positively over the forecast period. Small cells are radio access nodes that can have a range from 10 meters to a few miles. Small cell base stations can be installed indoors and outdoors since they provide internet access to a specific area. As of 2021, it was estimated that there were around 5000 small cells were deployed worldwide while the number was anticipated to be around 2000 in 2018. Hence, all these factors are projected to hike the market growth over the forecast period. 

By region, the Asia Pacific 5G base station market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by higher utilization of smartphones backed by the escalating penetration of IoT-connected devices in the region. For instance, it was expected that China will have nearly 5 billion IoT devices by 2030. Furthermore, the surge in investment in 5G-enabled smart devices and base stations backed by 5G new radio (NR) frequencies is also anticipated to boost the market growth over the forecast period. Furthermore, the market is anticipated to obtain the second-largest share in Europe region over the forecast period. The rising regional population owning smartphones and the presence of robust IT infrastructure in the region are estimated to expand the market size in the region over the forecast period. For instance, it was anticipated that in 2021, approximately 475 million people were using smartphones in the Europe region which is further expected to rise over the forecast period.
