**Rising Investments in Cloud Technologies to Drive the Market Growth**

Recent IT developments have contributed to the success and popularity of cloud technologies. The new computing and business models provide storage and computing resources on demand. The primary goal of cloud computing is to gain financial benefits, as cloud computing provides an efficient method for reducing operational and capital costs. Several players are increasingly investing in cloud computing infrastructure and services to reduce the costs of on-premises hardware and software. In February 2023, Oracle, a U.S.-based computer software company, announced an investment of USD 1.5 billion to expand its cloud infrastructure capabilities in Saudi Arabia with the introduction of a new public cloud.

**Growth Drivers:**

- Growing adoption of software as a service (SaaS)
- High volume of data generation

**Challenges:**

Despite the fact that cloud-based backup solutions are typically a cost-effective option, the price might increase dramatically if one needs to back up a huge volume of data. The vast majority of cloud service providers offer unlimited bandwidth, although this is by no means guaranteed. Several vendors have bandwidth limits and impose fees for exceeding them. Companies with already substantial and continually expanding data volumes may be severely harmed by this. Many of these issues contribute to restraining the market growth.
