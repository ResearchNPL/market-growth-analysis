**Increasing Implementation of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to Drive Growth of the Global Next Generation Computing Market**

The newest tech innovation, the Internet of Things, generates enormous amounts of data from networked devices such as home automation systems, GPS beacons, and virtual entertainment. The large volumes of data generated by these channels are increasingly being managed and stored through the use of next-generation computing. It generates a lot of sensitive data and stimulates interest in computing that is next generation. It entails monitoring temperatures, preparing for hardware failures, and turning on autonomous driving. There will be roughly 15.14 billion IoT devices by 2023. For instance, for the past seven years, the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Exascale Computing Project (ECP) has brought together a diverse team of computing professionals to improve next-generation computer architectures and revolutionize scientific modelling. One of the distinguishing features of ECP is its cooperation with industry partners that have advanced exascale research and development and successfully combined hardware, software, and applications to establish a fully functional exascale ecosystem.
