In 2022, the Indian government has partnered with Microsoft to empower small-holder farmers in India. The major aim is to accelerate the use of AI in farming. In this project, drones would be used for smooth scouting over land fields, collecting precious information, and transferring the data to farmers on a real-time basis. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DEITY), the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT), and the Information Technology Research Academy (ITRA) are just a few of the organizations that will provide funding for the initiative. Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Smart Farms Market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Investment in Agriculture Research Activities
- Declining Arable Land

**Challenges:**

Automated farm equipment, such as tractors, weeding robots, robot-assisted irrigation systems, tillers, and harvesters, is significantly more expensive than traditional farming equipment. Similarly, the high maintenance costs associated with advanced vehicles limit small farmers' adoption of innovative digital farming solutions. The prices of maintaining sensors, software, hardware, and cameras in these vehicles are also a restraining factor.
