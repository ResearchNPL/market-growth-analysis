In addition, the growing popularity of flat-panel displays, the current trends of these displays' widths becoming narrower, the rise in sales of television units worldwide, and these elements are all expected to drive market expansion. Additionally, it is estimated that the increasing usage of screens in various medical equipment will support market rise over the projected time.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global display component** market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Usage of LED Displays for TVs, Digital Signages
- Increasing Technologies Like Micro-LED And Mini-LED 

**Challenges:**

Digital advertisements are becoming more sophisticated, relevant, and customized these days. Due to the increase in internet usage, consumers are spending more time online than ever before. Digital advertising offers an ideal way to engage with customers who use many channels. The necessity for displays in the retail sector is therefore declining. Customers avoiding touch screen displays in public spaces due to the coronavirus outbreak is another factor hurting the display market. These reasons are preventing the display market from growing as predicted. Some of the key reasons predicted to hinder the size of the global display component market are the availability of alternatives and the high cost of the newest displays.

By technology, the global display component** market is segmented into LCD display, LED display, OLED and plasma display. The OLED segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. OLED screens are brighter, have wider viewing angles, better contrast, respond faster, and consume less electricity. OLED screens are naturally self-illuminating, thus they never require a backlight to give the optimum visibility in any kind of illumination. These advantages are what propel the market for OLED-based panels. The market for display components will grow as a result of these factors and developments, which will also improve the OLED technology industry.

By region, the Europe display component** market is to generate the significant revenue by the end of 2036. Over the course of the projection period, Europe's market is anticipated to grow at a consistent rate owing to an increase in innovations from major companies in the region's various countries. For example, Oppo registered the names Find N Fold and Find N Flip as trademarks with the European Union (EU) Intellectual Property Office on November 28, 2022. The business states that flip and foldable phones are the way of the future and that Oppo's upcoming generation of foldable phones will be available in Europe.
