**Network Attached Storage Market Growth Opportunities 2036**

The North America [**network attached storage market**](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/network-attached-storage-market/5296) is to generate the highest revenue during the forecast period. By the end of 2036, North America is anticipated to hold the highest share, at 35%.  

**Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Chronic Diseases to Promote Global Market Share of Network Attached Storage**

The growing use of the Internet results in more and more unstructured data being collected. Audio, video and photographic files are contained in these unintelligible data. But there has been a growing difficulty in keeping such data safely and securely. Cloud storage became necessary as data growth increased exponentially. In hybrid network attached data storage solutions, traditional NAS hardware or cloud storage is used. It gives you the ability to create a Virtual Database in which all data can be used at once from anywhere. With the use of a Hybrid NAS system, enterprises can exchange and store their essential data in an efficient manner. This has led to an increased interest of customers and enterprises in implementing network connected storage solutions.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global **network attached storage** market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increasing Adoption of Next-Generation Wireless Netwrok 
- Increasing Demand among Small and Mid-Size Businesses across End-Use Industries 

**Challenges:**

Because network attached storage systems have constrained resources, they slow down and develop performance-related issues as NAS user numbers rise. These systems can't scale up or out quickly since they require specialized NAS protocols like Server Message Block (SMB) and Network File System (NFS). These protocols are too sluggish for high-performance applications because of problems with high latency and low throughput. The main factors limiting the market expansion of network connected storage systems are thus their poor performance and difficulties in scaling up their capacity in comparison to Storage Area Network (SAN) and Direct connected Storage (DAS).

By product, the global **network attached storage** market is segmented into enterprise and midmarket. A 54% share of the midmarket segment is anticipated within the anticipated time frame. The current generation is highly technologically advanced and uses cutting-edge products like smartphones, tablets, and other smart devices. The volume of unstructured data in digital content has grown as a result of people using more and more electronic devices. To manage this enormous amounts of data, people use NAS systems. To store data generated by backup systems, media streaming devices, and video surveillance systems, consumers also select centralized NAS solutions. Although midmarket NAS systems are the best and most expensive solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, they can also be utilized for private purposes.

The market expansion is attributable to a number of top businesses, like Buffalo AMERICAS Inc., Dell Technologies Inc., Western Digital Corporation, and others. Due to increased commercial and public investment in wireless technology in this area, the market is growing. In 2021, the American wireless industry spent up to USD 35 billion on building out, improving, and running their networks, according to a survey. It was a record-setting investment and the fourth consecutive year that capital expenses increased. As a result, these elements are fueling the segment's expansion. A number of telecom firms also planned to develop 5G networks across the country. These factors are driving the market growth in the region.
