By device type, the global human-powered medical equipment market is segmented into implanted devices, and wearable. The wearable segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. It is expected that the most frequent chronic illnesses, which account for the majority of global death and disability, has resulted in a surge in the market demand for wearable technology that can aid in the management of chronic ailments by monitoring critical risk factors such as blood pressure, glucose, and other pertinent indicators to furnish real-time data, improve patient involvement, and assist healthcare practitioners.

Besides this, the implanted device segment is set to gain notable revenue during the forecast timeframe. Implantable medical devices such as pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), and cochlear implants that incorporate electronic circuits and batteries, are placed into the human body to fulfill specific duties have been utilized all around the world to save lives, boost quality of life, restore bodily functions, and minimize the need for invasive procedures.

By region, the European human-powered medical equipment market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by the growing elderly population. For instance, more than 20% of EU citizens were 65 years of age or older in 2022. Moreover, Europe leads the world in this regard, followed by North America as lately, more than 24% of Europeans are 65 years of age or older and this figure will reach over 25% by 2050. Those 65 years of age and above make up some of the oldest populations in the globe in Europe which is a result of the convergence of four demographic trends including low fertility rates, the postwar baby boom, rising life expectancy at birth, significant net migratory inflows.

Chronic diseases (CDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, chronic kidney diseases, chronic lung diseases, diabetes, heart attack, hip fracture, Parkinson's disease, and stroke are becoming more common as the population ages puts more strain on the public health system as well as on medical and social services in the European region.

These factors are expected to increase the demand for wearable medical gadgets that use flexible and conformable sensors for this purpose. in Western European countries for long-term monitoring that is considered necessary for CVD.
