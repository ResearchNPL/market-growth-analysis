**Expanding Aerospace Advancements to Promote Global Market Share of Sintered Metal Filters**

Aerospace applications demand filters capable of withstanding extreme conditions. Sintered metal filters, renowned for their durability and temperature resistance, are integral to aerospace systems. The continuous evolution of the aerospace sector fuels the demand for these filters. The global aerospace and defense sales are projected to reach USD 1.6 trillion by 2030.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global sintered metal filters market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

•	Durability and Longevity

•	Growing Technological Advancements

**Challenges:**

Complex maintenance procedures can increase downtime and operational costs for businesses, making them less inclined to use sintered metal filters. While sintered metal filters are known for their durability, they can be complex to maintain and clean, particularly in applications with heavy fouling. Sintered metal filters are typically made from specific metals, and their chemical compatibility varies. Incompatibility with certain fluids or chemicals can limit their use in some applications.
