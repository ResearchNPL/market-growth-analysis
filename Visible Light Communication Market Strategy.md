**Visible Light Communication Market Strategy 2036** 

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Visible Light Communication Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/visible-light-communication-market/5021): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global visible light communication market in terms of market segmentation by component, transmission type, application, and by region. 

**Rise in Adoption of Automotive to Boost Growth of Global Visible Light Communication Market** 

The global market for visible light communication is estimated to grow on account of the rise in the adoption of automobiles. Visible light communication is widely used in vehicle communication as a result of the availability of car lights and the already-existing system of traffic signals. This may include cooperative forward collision warning, emergency electronic brake lights, pre-crash sensing, lane change warning, left turn assistant, stop sign movement assistant, traffic signal violation warning, and curve speed warning.

Another key driver for visible light communication (VLC) systems is the rising acceptance and use of wireless applications. Investments are necessary for the market expansion of visible light communication (VLC) due to the issue of the radio spectrum bottleneck faced by Wi-Fi and cellular radio systems. Additionally, the popularity and use of VLC technology would grow as a result of technological developments that solve difficulties with network coverage and dependability, line of sight (LOS) requirements, and system setup complexity. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global visible light communication market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- Growth on its Application in the Healthcare Industry 
- Advancement in Educational Institutions 

**Challenges:**

The biggest problem is signal deterioration caused by environmental factors including fog, scintillation, absorption, scattering, and physical obstructions such as trees and birds during signal propagation, which leads to dependability problems. Optical beams are adversely affected by the atmosphere, and this effect intensifies with link length. Fog is the main obstacle to VLC communications. A network architecture that reduces the distances between VLC links and increases network redundancies is the main strategy for combating fog while installing VLC. Currently, fading of signals during propagation owing to environmental interference is providing a significant dependability concern. 

By application, the market visible light communication is segmented into consumer electronics, defense & security, transportation, public infrastructure, and life sciences. Out of these segments, the public infrastructure segment is expected to generate the highest revenue by the end of 20235. However, the transportation segment is also anticipated to grow. Traffic management is facing enormous difficulties as a result of rising traffic and population. For effective administration, the amount of data being communicated via public Wi-Fi is neither sufficient nor secure. In contrast to traffic management, vehicle-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication is a promising application for VLC. In traffic management systems, such as roadside lights and traffic signals employing VLC, there is a growing opportunity as traffic lights use LED lighting. For instance, pedestrians may cross a roadway by using a walker's smartphone with VLC to manage traffic from street lights. 

By region, the Asia Pacific market for visible light communication is anticipated to grow over the forecast period. Rising government initiatives for smart cities are responsible for the market expansion in this area. The concept of "smart cities" is significantly impacted by the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, merging Li-Fi and IoT might greatly enhance smart cities. Consequently, it is projected that visible-light communication would become more popular. Additionally, Li-Fi, which would also automate a number of smart city tasks, would make large-scale connectivity possible. The majority of public spaces are now powered by LED lights, which have previously been installed in many Asia Pacific countries. Therefore, it also projected increasing market demand in this area. 

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global visible light communication market which includes company profiling of LVX System, Panasonic Holdings Corporation, Lucibel SA, Koninklijke Philips NV, Firefly Networks LTD, Bytelight Inc., Purelifi Ltd, Oledcomm, Outstanding Technology Ltd, Axrtek Enterprises (P) LTD, and others.
