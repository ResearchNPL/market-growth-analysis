Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global power inductor** market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Use of Electric Vehicle
- Rising Data-Driven Decision Aid Businesses in Supply Chain Optimization

**Challenges:**

In addition to being more feature-rich and compact, products are also becoming more advanced. Mobile gadgets with advanced, complex functions are getting smaller and smaller all the time. The market for such items, which include smartwatches, wearables in the wristband style, and Internet of Things devices like sensor network devices, requires reduced size and thickness. These gadgets also need very efficient power supply circuits for longer operating times. As wearables like smartwatches get smaller and thinner, more multi-core and faster processors are being used for efficiency and performance. This allows for the reduction in size of all required parts, including inductors. Fluctuating costs and stringent rules are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of power inductor. 

By core, the global power inductor** market is segmented into shielded and non-shielded. The shielded segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The shielded inductor will trail this industry's expanding trend. They are widely used and are expanding the market quickly due to their capacity to efficiently minimize power supply noise in commercial, automotive, and industrial units and designs. During April 2022 and March 2023, the industry produced 2,59,31,867 automobiles, as opposed to 2,30,40,066 units between April 2021 and April 2022. Among these vehicles were passenger cars, trucks, tricycles, and two- and three-wheelers. 

By region, the Europe power inductor** market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. German enterprises that create inductors are expecting this increase to help the market for electronic equipment. Germany's electrical transmission infrastructure is up against various obstacles as it transitions to a new energy mix. During the approximated timeframe, the existence of prominent electric vehicle automotive firms in the region is expected to promote rapid market growth. European countries are enacting stricter emission laws for internal combustion engine cars, while industry investment in electric vehicles is expected to drive up demand for power inductors. In a similar vein, the growth of energy storage and renewable energy sources is favorable to the power inductors market.
