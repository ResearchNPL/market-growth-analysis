**Rising Demand for Online Shopping to Boost the Growth of the Global Application Security Market**

The global application security market is set to grow on account of the rising demand for online shopping. In order to stay competitive, e-retailers are now adding a variety of features and possibilities. Advanced feathers do, however, come with the possibility of cyber risk. Fraudsters typically carry out this activity by getting into e-commerce websites and obtaining user login or credit card information. They may use it to sell client information to other criminals online or to impersonate customers and make fraudulent purchases. Therefore, as the number of online consumers grows, so does the requirement for application security. 

Additionally, the expansion of the application security market is predicted to be fueled by the rising implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning in web- and mobile-based security processes in the coming years. Since, they can quickly analyze a large number of events and identify various threats from malware, zero-day vulnerabilities, and identifying risky behavior which may result in phishing attacks or download of malicious code, AI and machine learning (ML) are critical technologies in information security. Furthermore, these technologies aid in the detection and forecasting of novel attack types.

By organization size, the market for application security is segmented into SMEs and large enterprises. Out of these segments, the SMEs segment is anticipated to have significant growth over the forecast period. This could be owing to the growing threat to small businesses owing to cyberattacks. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) don't think they may be the target of an attack because of their low profile online and the fact that the media is focusing only on massive enterprise data breaches like those at Yahoo and TalkTalk. As a result, security breaches are more likely to happen. Small businesses are therefore more inclined to prioritize application security. 

By region, the Asia Pacific market for application security is set to have noteworthy growth over the forecast period. This is because security breaches are occurring more frequently in the region's developing economies, such as China and India. Additionally, it is projected that the growing number of small and medium-sized businesses in this region will assist the expansion of the application security market in the near future. 

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global application security market which includes company profiling of IBM Corporation, Capgemini Services SAS, Whitehat Security, Synopsys, Inc., SUBARU Corporation, Micro Focus, HCL Technologies Limited, Cisco Systems Inc., RapidAPI, Oracle Corporation, and others.
