**Lead Acid Battery Market Future Opportunities 2035**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Lead Acid Battery Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/lead-acid-battery-market/4726): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global lead acid battery market in terms of market segmentation by type, application, end-user, and by region. 

**Growing Instances of Power Cut-Offs to Drive Growth of the Global Lead Acid Battery Market**

The global lead acid battery market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing cases of long power outages. There are various reasons for power shortages, such as unfavorable extreme weather conditions, aging grids of electricity, and a shortage of fossil fuels which are slowing the production of electricity. Large backup power supplies for phone and computer centers, grid energy storage, and off-grid home electric power systems all frequently employ rechargeable batteries made for power supplies. In the event of a power outage, emergency equipment and pumping stations are both powered by lead-acid batteries. 350 million people, or more than 4% of the world's population, experienced severe power disruptions in 2021. The United States electrical grids will be under pressure in 2021 owing to a number of severe weather events. With severe weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, and snowstorms accounting for more than five of those hours, or almost seventy-two percent of the total, families lost electricity for an average of seven hours and twenty minutes.

Besides this, market growth is also expected on the back of a rise in the number of data centers. A valve-regulated lead-acid cell battery powers the uninterrupted power supply or power outage in the majority of data centers. There were more than 8,000 data centers spread over 110 different nations as of January 2021. These six nations are made up of the United States, which accounts for 33% of all data centers. Moreover, other countries such as the United Kingdom, and China accounted for nearly 6% and 5%, respectively. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global lead acid battery market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Demand for Battery Operated Electronic Items
- Growing Network of Data Center

**Challenges:**

The availability of less expensive lead acid battery alternatives. The availability of lithium-ion batteries and aluminum-air batteries, which are even more affordable than lead-acid batteries, makes them a more cost-effective technology. Also, nickel-metal hydride batteries are the most effective for hybrid applications. Major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) such as Honda, Toyota, Lexus, and others employ them. Moreover, as a great substitute for lead-acid batteries, nickel-cadmium is also available. Furthermore, the requirement for regular maintenance to extend battery life and tight standards and regulations for lead acid battery production are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global lead acid battery market. It must regularly top off the lead acid batteries with distilled water to keep them in good condition and ensure that they last at least as long as they should. Also, if these lead-acid batteries are not placed correctly during charging, they may produce dangerous acidic gas. They must be kept upright to prevent battery acid spillage, thus production regulations are tight.**  

By end users, the global lead acid battery market is segmented into automotive, oil & gas, utilities, telecommunications, construction, marine, and others. The telecommunications segment is anticipated to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The segment's expansion can be ascribed to the global acceptance of the internet and the increasing use of mobile phones. Almost 60% of the world's population, or more than 4 billion individuals, uses social media. In addition, nearly 5 billion people, or 64% of the world's population, were internet users as of January 2023. Furthermore, global smartphone subscriptions currently exceed six billion, and in the upcoming years, that number is anticipated to rise by several hundred million more. China, India, and the United States are the countries with the largest populations of smartphone users. Owing to the combination of dependability, endurance, and flexibility to function as either passive or active components in backup power applications, lead-acid batteries are quite popular in the telecommunication industry.

By region, the Asia Pacific lead acid battery market is expected to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by growing power scarcity and expanding capabilities of off-grid power systems. The worst power outage in more than six years occurred at the same time as the extreme heatwave in 2023. Power outages ranging from two hours to eight hours or longer are being experienced by Indians across the country, from Jammu and Kashmir to Andhra Pradesh. In addition to this, battery importers are another factor contributing to the market expansion in the area. According to Rule 5 of the Batteries (Management & Handling) Regulations, 2001, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC)/Central Pollution Control Board has registered 82 importers of lead acid batteries. Moreover, China's off-grid renewable energy capacity climbed to 906.23 gigawatts in 2021, a rise of approximately 5%. In addition, the expansion of lead acid battery importers is another factor contributing to the market expansion in the area.
