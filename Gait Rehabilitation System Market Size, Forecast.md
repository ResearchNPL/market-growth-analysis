The global gait rehabilitation system market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the rising cases of orthopedic disorders. The growing number of orthopedic injuries, such as fractures, ligament tears, or muscle strains, can alter typical gait patterns and necessitate rehabilitation to reestablish ideal gait mechanics and avoid compensatory movements, which is predicted to propel market expansion. In addition, gait rehabilitation may be necessary for patients who have joint replacement procedures, such as hip, knee, or ankle replacements, in order to improve joint stability, optimize functional mobility, and restore normal gait mechanics. In 2021, roughly 1 billion people globally experienced musculoskeletal issues.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global gait rehabilitation system market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Technological Advancements
- Rising Traumatic Brain Injuries

**Challenges:**

The presence of alternative therapies at an affordable price, and the lack of skilled professionals are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of the gait rehabilitation system. One of the key elements projected to hinder the market's growth is the availability of alternative treatment choices. For instance, patients or healthcare professionals may choose alternative therapies as they believe them to be more cost-effective or accessible than gait rehabilitation methods.

By product type, the global gait rehabilitation system market is segmented into computerized services and mechanical type. The mechanical type segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to the growing incidence of sports injuries. For instance, mechanical-type gait rehabilitation systems have shown promising treatment results in individuals with sports injuries. Also, as part of their preparation for their return to activity, athletes who are healing from sports-related ailments including ankle sprains, stress fractures, or muscular strains may need gait treatment. Mechanical gait rehabilitation tools can aid athletes in a progressive transition from walking to running or other sports-specific movements, reducing the risk of re-injury and enhancing performance. In the US, over 30 million children and teenagers participate in organized sports, and more than 3 million suffer injuries as a result.

By region, the North America gait rehabilitation system market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by the higher number of neurological disorders and sports injuries in the region. Neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury can all affect gait and mobility in addition to sports-related injuries such as ligament tears, fractures, and spinal cord injuries. As the prevalence of these disorders rises in the area, there is a growing need for gait rehabilitation technologies to help people restore or enhance their walking ability. For instance, gait rehabilitation systems, which contain a variety of technologies and therapies focused on improving walking and mobility, are widely used in the rehabilitation process for persons with neurological issues and sports injuries. Additionally, it is projected that investments made by major businesses and organizations in the region's R&D sector and the rising demand for cutting-edge products would both support market expansion.

` `According to research, sports, and recreational activities account for more than 20% of all traumatic brain injuries among American children.
