**Rapid Adoption Of Automation In Industrial Application To Promote Global Market Share Of Hydraulic Power Unit**

The global hydraulic power unit market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the growing trend of automation in manufacturing. As per estimations than 64% of manufacturing activities worldwide have the potential to be automated. With the increasing automation in manufacturing processes, there is a growing need for power units. These units play a role, in providing power to the machinery and equipment involved in these automated processes. To illustrate hydraulic systems are utilized for regulating the motion of arms and other types of automated machinery. Hydraulic systems do not provide the necessary power for automated machinery but they also have a crucial role, in maintaining safety and efficiency during these operations. For instance, hydraulic brakes can swiftly halt automated machinery in case of an emergency.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global hydraulic power unit market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising adoption of advanced technologies such as automation and robotics in the industrial sector
- Increasing demand for efficient and reliable power solutions, such as hydraulics, in various industrial applications

**Challenges:**

The high cost of raw materials and the lack of available resources such as rare earth metals and other critical components for the production of hydraulic power units can also have a negative impact on the market growth. Furthermore, stringent environmental regulations and the increasing focus on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power are expected to further limit the growth of this market.

By component, the global hydraulic power unit market is segmented into power, control, and auxiliary. The auxiliary segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Auxiliary parts like valves pumps and other components find extensive usage in hydraulic power units. The reason behind this lies in the growing need for efficient hydraulic power units, which necessitate the proper functioning of auxiliary components. Moreover, the rise of cutting edge technologies like hydraulic valves and pumps has further augmented the demand for auxiliary components within the market, for hydraulic power units.

By region, the Asia Pacific hydraulic power unit market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. The regions market growth is predicted to increase due to factors, including the rising energy demand expanding population and the presence of emerging economies that are quickly adopting advanced technologies. Additionally, the region is expected to benefit from increased investments in infrastructure and the development of cities. To illustrate in the 2022 23 budget the Indian government has allocated 35.4% of funds towards infrastructure development. This allocation marks an increase from INR 5.54 trillion in year 2021-2022 to INR 7.50 trillion in the upcoming fiscal year 2022-23. Consequently, there will be a surge in demand for Hydraulic Power Units since these units are extensively utilized in infrastructure projects, like bridge construction and road building.
