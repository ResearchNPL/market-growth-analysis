**Duplex Stainless Steel Market Size 2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Duplex Stainless Steel Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/duplex-stainless-steel-market/4928): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the Duplex Stainless Steel Market in terms of market segmentation by grade, product form, end-use industry and by region. 

**Rise in Utilization of Duplex Stainless-Steel in Paper & Pulp Industry to Boost the Growth of Global Duplex Stainless Steel Market** 

The global Duplex Stainless Steel Market is projected to grow on account of rising utilization of duplex stainless-steel in paper & pulp industry. The industry that uses stainless steel the most is the pulp and paper industry. Numerous advantages offered by duplex stainless steels nicely coincide with the requirements of contemporary pulp and paper plants. Resistance to pitting, fatigue, and abrasion is a critical function of duplex stainless steel in tension. Moreover, duplex stainless steels have a strength that is roughly twice as great as austenitic steels, which may result in the material losing a substantial amount of weight. The processes and methods utilized in pulping nowadays have been impacted by environmental concerns. The mild steel digesters are no longer in operation due to a few adjustments that have made working conditions more difficult. The demand for corrosion-resistant duplex stainless steel, which is utilized in pulp and paper mills, has undoubtedly increased as a result of these higher compound concentrations and operating temperatures.  

Additionally, the marine industry makes substantial use of stainless steel. Everything from ships themselves to LNG tanks, chemical tankers, and the cargo containers they transport uses duplex stainless steel. It provides the yield strength necessary to endure even the most hostile marine environments in addition to the ability to resist corrosion. In fact, new scrubbing tools have been made from duplex stainless steel.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Duplex Stainless Steel Market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising Construction Activities 
- Surge in Offshore Drilling 

**Challenges:**

Several elements required for the production of duplex stainless steel, stainless steel, and iron-based alloys are included in the critical raw material (CRM) list. Chromium (Cr) is one of the elements that make up the different grades of duplex stainless steel. It is essential for preserving the material's corrosion resistance in a variety of environments and applications. On the other hand, the market for duplex stainless steel is also being hampered by the shortage of these basic materials. 

By end-use industry, the market for duplex stainless steel is segmented into oil & gas, pulp & paper, chemical, desalination, and others. Out of these segments, the oil & gas segment is projected to capture the highest market revenue of USD 3.18 Billion by the end of 2036. In the oil and gas industry, duplex stainless steel must perform to extraordinarily high requirements in terms of corrosion resistance and overall quality. Petroleum exploration, transportation, and storage all require stainless steel components to have high compressive strength and resistance to corrosion. Additionally, duplex stainless steel is especially useful in the oil and gas industry because of its chemical resistance and endurance. It is used for tanks, platforms, cable trays and subsea pipes. 

By region, the Europe market for duplex stainless-steel is projected to grow over the forecast period. Duplex stainless steel (DSS) has been increasingly used as a building material in the local pulp and paper sector in the region because of its exceptional resistance to corrosion and high mechanical strength, which enable equipment thickness reduction. 

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global Duplex Stainless Steel Market which includes company profiling of NIPPON STEEL Stainless Steel Corporation, Industeel, Jindal Stainless, Daido Steel Co., Ltd., Thyssenkrupp AG, Shandong Linxu Materials Co., Ltd., Sandvik AB, Acerinox, POSCO, Penn Stainless, and others.
