The market is segmented by bacterial injection, type and application. Based on bacterial injection, the microbial flooding segment is anticipated to acquire the largest share during the forecast period on the back of high utilization of microbial flooding to increase recovery and prolong life span of oil wells. Additionally, by application, the onshore segment is projected to grab the largest share over the forecast period attributing to the large number of mature onshore oilfields located in the Middle East and North America regions. 

Geographically, the global microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) market is segmented into five major regions, namely North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is evaluated to grab the largest share in the market during the forecast period attributing to the high usage of MEOR to discover unconventional resources in the Atlantic Ocean, and continuous development in shake reserves in the region. Moreover, the market in Asia Pacific is assessed to witness modest growth in the future owing to the rising government initiatives for recovery of crude oil in the region.
