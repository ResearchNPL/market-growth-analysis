Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global microcrystalline cellulose** market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Demand for Gluten Free Food Globally
- Rising Consumption of Hair and Skin Care Products

**Challenges:**

It is anticipated that MCC will be manufactured from another plant-based product in order to lower the cost of production, which is predicted to bring in a highly appealing price when compared with wood or non-wood pulp goods. These reasons are anticipated to impede the expansion of marketplaces across the globe. Additionally, it is predicted that the production process and expensive raw materials will impede market expansion. Governmental constraints, environmental difficulties, and numerous new excipients in the pharmaceutical industry are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of microcrystalline cellulose.

By raw material source, the global microcrystalline cellulose** market is segmented into wood-based and non-wood-based. The non-wood-based segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The rise in the usage of non-wood sources, such as cotton fibers, palm hulls, oil palm forest leftovers, corn cobs, cotton fibres, wheat hull, soya bean and alfa fibre, has been a major factor in this market's expansion. Additionally, rising global demand for food and beverage items is a major factor driving market segment growth. India's food and beverage industry is predicted to be worth more than USD 960 billion by 2023 as a result.

By region, the Asia Pacific microcrystalline cellulose** market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. The market's expansion can be largely attributable to the region's residents' rising economic standards and rising employment rates. The regional market is expected to increase as a result of the expansion of sectors including paints, coatings, and ceramics, as well as the expanding construction industry.
