Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Quantum Communication Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/quantum-communication-market/5747): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global quantum communication market in terms of market segmentation by product type, security service, application and by region. 

**Rising Concern for Securing Client Information and Rise in Online Gaming to Promote Global Market Share of Quantum Communication Market**

The global quantum communication market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased utilization of the technique in the defense and government industries and the surge in the adoption of secure communication techniques. For instance, the most common types of attacks in aerospace and defense over the past three years have been ransomware attacks (22.1%), data breaches (18.5%), and phishing attacks (15%). Quantum sensors have the potential to revolutionize military operations by providing unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision. On the back of this, the global quantum communication market is anticipated to garner remarkable growth during the forecasted period. Other than this, there are numerous breaches in credit card security. For instance, credit card fraud costs the world almost USD 14.1 billion annually. Quantum communication has plenty of potential for encrypting credit cards and protecting them against threats. There has been a rising adoption of quantum communication to curb this loss, fueling the global quantum communication market growth during the forecast period. Other than this, the widespread inclusion of the Internet of Things is prompting the quantum communication market growth. With the use of quantum cryptography, data can be encrypted and establish secure keys across the devices. Owing to the increased adoption of quantum communication in the Internet of Things, the global quantum communication market growth is projected to garner remarkable growth during the forecasted period.
