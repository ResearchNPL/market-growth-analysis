**Additive Manufacturing Market Growth Analysis 2036**

The North American [**additive manufacturing market**](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/additive-manufacturing-market/5009) is to generate the maximum market revenue among all the other regions by the end of 2036. The government in the region is allocating funds for research and development in emerging technologies, such as additive manufacturing.

**Growing Investment in 3d Printing to Promote Global Market Share of Additive Manufacturing**

The global additive manufacturing market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased investment by the government in 3d printing and the growing demand for 3d printers. The United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense started the TAMPA project, worth 5 million Euros, in October 2022, to integrate additive manufacturing in the defense of weapons and other systems. Further, in the United States also, the government-sponsored the Forward Additive Manufacturing Programme. To help its smaller US-based suppliers grow their use of additive manufacturing, popularly known as 3D printing. Furthermore, in the primary three quarters of 2022, the total volume of printers exported from China was over 1 million units. Moreover, around 2 million 3D printers were shipped in 2021; by 2030, this amount is predicted to climb to 22 million.

Besides this, the market is also attributed to the rising use of additive manufacturing in the automotive and medical industries. Complex and elaborate designs are achievable with additive manufacturing that would not be viable with standard manufacturing processes. It enables the development of lightweight components of the vehicle, which in turn increases the overall fuel efficiency of the vehicle. Materials such as alloys, aluminum, steel, and polymer composites are the most used in making components. Other than this, it also helps in forging the prototypes of medical equipment and devices. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global additive manufacturing market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge Demand for 3D Printers
- Rising Government Efforts to Increase its Adoption

**Challenges:**

The initial cost of implementing the 3d printer is very high in many regions, and people who lack the technical knowledge are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of additive manufacturing. But the cost of specialized materials, particularly those with high-performance qualities, might have an impact on the price range.  The price of the full machine depends on the material used in it. As a result, they might be quite pricey when compared to typical manufacturing equipment.

On the basis of end users, the global additive manufacturing market is fragmented into healthcare, automotive, aerospace, industrial, consumer goods, construction, and defense. The automotive segment is to collect the maximum market share by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growing popularity of electric vehicles is expected to drive the segment growth. Additive manufacturing is employed in electric vehicle battery housings to create complicated cooling channels and heat exchangers. Furthermore, on the basis of technology, the market is segmented into stereolithography (SLA), fused deposition modeling (FDM), laser sintering (LS), EBM, binder jetting printing, laminated object manufacturing (LOM), and polyjet printing. Out of all, the fused deposition modeling (FDM) segment will show significant growth in the projected time frame. Moreover, the demand for industrial printers has shown notable growth owing to the need for a rising need for prototyping. 

Moreover, a rise in collaboration with the private sector is also expected to drive market growth in the region. In North America, the government has facilitated the creation of collaborative platforms that brings together all the big and small players of the industry. These initiatives serve as a catalyst in the market expansion. The US government worked with ASTRO America to establish 3D printers in the defense sector for the fabrication of equipment.
