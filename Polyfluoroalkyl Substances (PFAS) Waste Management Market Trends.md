<a name="_hlk147244479"></a><a name="_hlk153828483"></a>The perfluorooctanoic acid segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Growing public awareness of the potential health risks associated with PFOA exposure generates pressure on industries to manage and mitigate contamination. As public concern rises, there is an increased focus on waste management strategies to prevent further environmental and human exposure to PFOA. The demand for responsible waste management practices is thus driven by heightened public consciousness regarding the health implications of PFOA. Studies linking PFOA exposure to health issues have raised public awareness. For instance, a 2013 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) linked PFOA exposure to kidney and testicular cancer.
