The global high performance ceramic coatings market is anticipated to attain a CAGR of 9% over the forecast period, i.e., 2023 – 2035. The market is segmented by end-user into automotive, aviation, chemical equipment, medical, and others. Out of these, the automotive segment is anticipated to hold the notable share over the forecast period owing to the increasing sale of automobiles. According to the data by the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, around 77.971 million units of cars were sold in 2020 globally. Moreover, the demand for efficient protective coating for the vehicles is estimated to fuel the segment growth.

The global high performance ceramic coatings market is estimated to grow on the back of higher resistance to temperature and corrosion provided by high performance ceramic coatings or HPCC. Moreover, the tough outer shell of a dried ceramic coating can chemically bond to the metal substrate, providing insulation, and friction resistance to the surface. Such factors make HPCC ideal for coating over automobiles especially cars. The growing demand for high resistance coatings in vehicles is estimated to boost the market growth. Furthermore, the increasing manufacturing and sales of automobiles are also estimated to boost the market growth.

On the basis of geographical analysis, the global high performance ceramic coatings market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa region. The market in the North America region is anticipated to gain the largest market share throughout the forecast period owing to the presence of major automobile manufacturers in the region. Along with this, the increasing production and demand for automobiles is also estimated to propel the market growth.
