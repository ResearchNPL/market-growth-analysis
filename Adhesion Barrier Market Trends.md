**Adhesion Barrier Market Trends 2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Adhesion Barrier Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/adhesion-barrier-market/4535): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global Adhesion Barrier market in terms of market segmentation by product, formulation, application, end-user and by region. 

**Growing Prevalence of Chronic Diseases to Promote Global Market Share of Adhesion Barrier**

The global adhesion barrier market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing cases of chronic disorders. Chronic diseases, which include diabetes, functional gastrointestinal disorders, eczema, arthritis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are on the rise around the world, accounting for more than 70% of all deaths. In the developing world, heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases are becoming significant issues which are all anticipated to rise by 2060. It is expected that rapid urbanization, globalization, unhealthy lifestyles, and the rising elderly population are all key causes of the top chronic diseases. Chronic diseases are long-term illnesses that do not improve or disappear on their own therefore few chronic conditions including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and renal failure can raise the risk of surgical complications. This is expected to significantly drive the demand for adhesion barriers as it is a medical device that can be used to separate internal tissues and organs during healing after surgery and reduce adhesion formation by lowering the incidence, extent, and severity.

For instance, the proportion of total world fatalities owing to chronic diseases is anticipated to rise to more than 60% by 2030, with the global disease burden rising to over 55%.

The global adhesion barrier market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing road accidents. In developing countries, vulnerability to possible road traffic injury has increased owing to poor road infrastructure, distracted driving, drunk driving, speeding/reckless driving, and extreme weather conditions such as dense fog, considerable rain, strong winds, and so on. Moreover, increased speed increases the likelihood of an accident as faster vehicles are more likely to be involved in an accident than slower vehicles. For instance, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), every 1% increase in mean speed results in a 4% increase in the probability of a fatal crash and a 3% increase in the risk of a major crash. Severe injuries caused by road accidents may increase the need for surgical intervention which may create a huge demand for adhesion barriers as adhesions arise once surgery begins and adhesive barrier dramatically reduces the severity of adhesions.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global adhesion barrier market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Presence of Trauma Care Centers Globally
- Rising Product Approvals

**Challenges:**

The reluctance to use adhesion barriers, and the stringent regulations developed by the government of nations worldwide are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of adhesion barrier. As there are no standard recommendations for using these barriers, which may limit their utilization among healthcare practitioners.

By application, the global adhesion barrier market is segmented into gynecological surgeries, abdominal general surgeries, orthopedic surgeries, cardiovascular surgeries, neurological surgeries, and urological surgeries. The cardiovascular surgeries segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Cardiovascular surgery, often known as cardiac surgery, refers to any surgical treatment that affects the heart or blood arteries and is performed to correct heart issues such as heart failure and plaque accumulation. Owing to postoperative adhesions, heart surgery carries an elevated risk however, some barriers inhibit the production of adhesions that facilitate reoperations in complicated congenital heart surgery.

By region, the Europe adhesion barrier market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by rising geriatric population in the region.  For instance, Italy had the highest proportion of elderly people in Europe in 2022, accounting for more than 20% of the total population. This may significantly drive the demand for adhesion barriers in the region as older people are at higher risk of chronic diseases that require surgical intervention.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global adhesion barrier market which includes company profiling of Becton Dickinson and Company, Baxter International, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Anika Therapeutic, Inc., FzioMed, Inc., Mast Biosurgery, Inc., Innocoll Holdings PLC, Atrium Medical Corporation.
