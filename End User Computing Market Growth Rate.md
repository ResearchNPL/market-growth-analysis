**Widespread Remote Working Culture to Promote Global Market Share of End User Computing**

The global end-user computing market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the rising technological advances such as the advent of digital technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data that are playing a major role in managing remote staff. According to a survey conducted in June of 2022, 8 in 10 people are working hybrid or remote, while only 2 in 10 are entirely on-site. And this trend is anticipated to continue shortly. With the increasing transition in working methods and the rising need to make it a seamless process, the adoption of EUC is also exponentially expanding. Moreover, the uptrend of bring your device (BYOD) and other such trends led more organizations to employ end-user computing to provide access to corporate applications and data across multiple device types. As per research, it is also estimated that companies that switch to BYOD smartphones can save up to around USD 341 per employee, which is why this culture is further expected to uptrend.
