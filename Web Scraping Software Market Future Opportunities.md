**Challenges:**

Data scraping from websites is not always a simple process. IP filtering and CAPTCHA are only two of the numerous challenges users may run against when trying to retrieve data. Platform owners use these tactics to prevent web scraping, which could hinder clients' access to data. Website access is prevented by bots using the Fully Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart, or CAPTCHA. The main objectives of CAPTCHAs are to limit service registrations to human users and to stop ticket inflation. They not only jeopardize SEO strategies but also put healthy bots like Googlebot, which compiles content from the internet into a searchable index for the Google search engine, at risk. The most popular way to stop web scrapers from accessing a website's data is to ban IP addresses. This usually occurs when a website detects that many requests are originating from the same IP address. If the website decides to stop scraping, it will either completely forbid the IP address or restrict access to it. The CAPTCHA blockers and IP blockers is expected to hamper the market growth.

The development of new categories is being propelled by the benefits of cloud-based internet scraping technologies. Although cloud scraping services are often enabled by browser extensions, such as Google Chrome extensions, the actual scraping process takes place on the cloud or server. Consequently, they may be set up and accessed from any location or device. Most cloud-based data extraction providers offer programming interfaces (APIs) so that developers may create scripts or programs to scrape data from websites using their platform. This feature is absent from local web scraping software. This also plays a big part in the segment's growth.
