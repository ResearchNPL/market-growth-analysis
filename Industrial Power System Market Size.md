**Growing Demand for Energy-Efficient Devices in the Industrial Sector Worldwide to Drive Market Growth**

The industrial sector is responsible for using a larger amount of delivered energy as compared to other end users. This increase in energy consumption also leads to rise in emissions of greenhouse gases, air pollution and global warming, which is projected to promote the utilization of energy-efficient devices that minimize exploitation of natural resources. This in turn is anticipated to drive significant growth to the market in the near future.

Asia pacific is evaluated to occupy the largest share in the market during the forecast period attributing to the rising demand for industrial power supply to deliver power to the growing electricity load in the region. Moreover, the market in Asia Pacific is also assessed to witness noteworthy growth over the forecast period ascribing to the escalating industrialization and urbanization in the region.

However, difficulty to sell power supply products in lower economic regions is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of the global industrial power system market over the forecast period.
