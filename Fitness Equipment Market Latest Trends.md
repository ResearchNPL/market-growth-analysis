` `**Rising Concern of People About Their Health to Promote Global Market Share of Fitness Equipment** 

The global fitness equipment market is predicted to grow majorly owing to the higher involvement of people in physical activity. After the advent of COVID-19, people have become more aware of their physical health, which in turn has motivated people to get active and involved in any sort of physical activity. Around 60% of those surveyed believe the pandemic has enhanced their knowledge of the significance of keeping a healthy lifestyle in order to prevent health problems; this is a long-term change, not a momentary one. Adults aged 18 to 64 ought to take part in at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical exercise per week, according to the World Health Organization. Furthermore, inactivity among people can also lead to various chronic diseases, such as obesity diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and others. For instance, as per the data of WHO those who are insufficiently active are 20% to 30% more likely to die than those who are sufficiently active.

Besides this, the government is also taking initiatives to create awareness about physical activity. A growing regulatory endeavor is projected to increase demand for physical fitness. The World Health Organization launched a Global Action Plan on Physical Activity (GAPPA) for the years 2018-2030, with the goal of increasing physical activity globally and reducing inactivity prevalence by 15% by 2030.

Fitness equipment is really expensive and they are huge so they need wide space to get installed are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of fitness equipment. The cost of fitness equipment is high which makes them unaffordable for a single person to buy all. Moreover, due to the same reason, gym subscriptions are also expensive, which again makes it uneconomical for many people. On the other hand, there is a high risk of germ transmission from the use of fitness equipment at public centers. There is a high amount of sweating and bodily contact with the equipment in a compact area, that is why fitness centers contain a variety of fungi, bacteria, and viruses. They transmit through contact with everything, including gym mats, equipment, and the floor. According to studies, 10% to 30% of gym equipment surfaces carried bacteria that could lead to skin infections and other problems
