**Global Theft and Robbery Incidence to Promote Global Market Share of Home Security Systems**

The global home security systems market is estimated to grow majorly on account of increasing rates of theft and robbery around the world. According to the FBI, there are approximately 6k burglaries every day in the United States, with one burglary taking place every 13 seconds, four burglaries taking place every 20 minutes, and 240 burglaries an hour. A heist occurs in every third house without a security system, compared to one in 250 with one. People are becoming more aware of the need for home security systems, as they provide peace of mind and protection against theft and robbery. Additionally, technological advancements in the home security industry have made systems more affordable and accessible, increasing their popularity.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global home security systems market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- An increasing number of home security devices are being adopted, including CCTV cameras, motion sensors, and doorbell cameras.
- increase in consumer expenditure on smart home technology in recent years

**Challenges:**

The global market size of home security systems is expected to be hindered by high installation costs and system complexity. The cost of installing a home security system can be expensive and the complexity of the system may be daunting for some customers, leading them to opt for less expensive or less effective alternatives. Additionally, the lack of technical expertise to install and maintain the system can also be a major barrier.

By service, the global home security systems market consists of video surveillance systems, alarm systems, access control systems, fire protection services, and remote monitoring services. A significant CAGR is forecast for the video surveillance system segment by 2036, resulting in the highest revenue. Video surveillance systems are increasingly being adopted due to the increasing awareness of security threats and the need for better security solutions. China installed 53% of the world's surveillance cameras as of 2021, with approximately 1 billion surveillance cameras installed worldwide. Additionally, technological advancements and the development of AI-enabled video surveillance systems are also contributing to the growth of the segment.

According to market forecasts, North America will generate the most revenue from home security systems by 2036. There is an expectation of this growth by the increasing demand for more advanced and reliable home security systems, as well as the rising trend of home automation. In addition, internet-connected devices, like smart thermostats, locks, and cameras, are becoming increasingly popular, along with mandatory fire safety and safety regulations. As a result of the increasing number of fires in recent years, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National Fire Protection Association issued fire safety regulations that contributed to this growth. There are approximately 4,800 - 5,000 fire-related deaths in this country every year, and another 25,000 people are injured. Every residential and commercial property must be equipped with smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and emergency exits as a condition of compliance with these regulations.
