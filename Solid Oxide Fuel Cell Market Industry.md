**Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Market Industry 2031**

The Europe [solid oxide fuel cell market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/solid-oxide-fuel-cell-market/3514) is to generate significant revenue with a CAGR of 24.8 % over the forecast period. The growth is driven by increasing R&D efforts which are backed by investments made by the government to advance fuel cell programs. The UltraSOFC project, which is funded by ERC (European Research Council) under the European Union research and innovation program Horizon 2020, aims to break the temperature limits of SOFC technology and open new opportunities with ultrathin portable power sources. Moreover, solid oxide fuel cell market in the region is estimated to propel due to the policies involved to develop solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology and getting closer to providing cost-competitive fossil-based power generation with almost no emissions. For instance, the European Union has established the goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% - 95% by 2050, as compared to 1990 levels, by increasing the share of renewables in the EU energy mix. As per the European Union, solid oxide technologies such as SOFC could be the key enablers for such integration.

**Increase Adoption of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells in Data Centers to Drive Growth of the Global Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Market**

The recent developments by the companies in solid oxide fuel cells for data centers backed the market growth. For instance, in December 2020, Bosch is developing a decentralized solid oxide fuel cell system (SOFC). Bosch will propel its SOFC system's industrialization for green power generation in a future hydrogen economy. SOFCs are well matched for stationary power generation for data centers and businesses, providing an excellent opportunity for SOFCs in power generation. High temperatures make them exceptionally well organized for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems.
