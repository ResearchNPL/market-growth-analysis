The availability of specialized physicians and doctors in hospitals to provide a wide range of treatment options is propelling the market segment growth in the coming years. Additionally, the presence of all resources required to provide knowledge associated with the rare issues is estimated to drive the market segment growth. As of 2022, there are more than 6100 hospitals in use in the United States. 

By region, the Asia Pacific blood culture tests market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by increasing the incidence of infectious diseases across the region. The rising bacterial infections leading to sepsis and bacteremia are also propelling the market growth. The growing laboratory facilities in the region and developmental activities conducted to improve the infrastructure of the healthcare sector to improve the health needs of the people are estimated to hike the market growth.
