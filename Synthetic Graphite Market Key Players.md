**Synthetic Graphite Market Key Players 2035**

Research Nester released a report titled **“[Synthetic Graphite Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/synthetic-graphite-market/2848): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2023-2035”** which delivers detailed overview of the global synthetic graphite market in terms of market segmentation by product, application, end user and by region.

Further, for the in-depth analysis, the report encompasses the industry growth indicators, restraints, supply and demand risk, along with detailed discussion on current and future market trends that are associated with the growth of the market.

Synthetic graphite is an artificial graphite extracted from the refining of hydrocarbon materials and are produced at ultra-high temperatures. They possess high strength-to-weight capability, high heat tolerance, strength, and rigidity. Owing to the growing demand for lithium-ion batteries from the electric vehicle industry and the expanding steel industries, the global synthetic graphite market is anticipated to record a notable CAGR of 4% over the forecast period, i.e., 2023-2035. The market is segmented by application into batteries & energy devices, metallurgy, nuclear, metal fabrication, refractory, foundry, and others, out of which, the metallurgy segment is anticipated to hold the leading share in the synthetic graphite market. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the huge production of electrodes made from synthetic graphite used in metallurgical applications as a source of energy for various manufacturing processes.
