Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Atomic Force Microscopy Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/atomic-force-microscopy-market/5250): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global atomic force microscopy** market in terms of market segmentation by offering, application, grade, and by region. 

**Increasing Various Technologies and Techniques to Promote the Global Market Share of Atomic Force Microscopy**

Due to the rising demand for high-speed diagnostics on a global scale, the atomic force microscope (AFM) market is growing. Rising corporate investments and technological advancements are further favorable factors for the atomic force microscope (AFM) industry. In 2022, businesses throughout the globe invested about USD 92 billion in artificial intelligence (AI).

Additionally, there is lucrative potential for market participants due to the rising need for high-speed diagnostics and the use of atomic force microscopes for coronavirus research. The dedication of several governments to advancing nanotechnology and nanoscience research and development, together with the high component densities of contemporary semiconductor chips that necessitate exceptionally smooth and uniform surfaces, drive market expansion. Over 1197405 confirmed cases of the 2019 new coronavirus (COVID-19) have been reported from 181 different countries.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global atomic force microscopy** market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Investment in Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) Manufacturing and Development-
- Rising Commitment of Various Governments to Support the Advancement of Nanotechnology and Nanoscience

**Challenges:**

Damage to samples can be caused due to contact mode atomic force microscopy. In order to direct the tip in contact mode along a direction that is consistent with strong and repellent tip sample force, an input loop shall be used. Frictional and adhesive forces are very important for this mode, since the tip always has contact with the surface. Friction and adhesion forces can cause damage to surface attached microscopic specimens, e.g. polymers or biomorphic macromolecules. In the field of atomic force microscopy, there is a shortage of skilled professionals and the high cost of atomic force microscopes worldwide are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of atomic force microscopy. 

By grade, the global atomic force microscopy** market is segmented into industrial and research. The industry segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. This is due to its ability to detect and display virtually any size surface structure, industrial grade atomic force microscopes are requested more than research-grade atomic force microscopes. It is possible to detect and interpret even tiny surface structures, which are unprecedented when it comes to product analysis, using atomic force microscopy. 

By region, the Asia Pacific atomic force microscopy** market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. Growing expertise and academic brilliance, greater nanotechnology research, higher R&D investment for microscope development, and the affordability of nanomaterials are all aspects boosting the market in APAC.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global atomic force microscopy** market which includes company profiling of Bruker Corporation**,** Oxford Instruments**,** AFM Workshop, Anton Paar GmbH, Nanonics Imaging, Nanosurf AG, Witec, and others.
