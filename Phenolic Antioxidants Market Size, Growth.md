**Phenolic Antioxidants Market Size, Growth 2036** 

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Phenolic Antioxidants Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/phenolic-antioxidants-market/5027): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global phenolic antioxidants market in terms of market segmentation by type, form, application, source, and by region. 

**Rising Application of Antioxidants in the Healthcare Sector to Boost the Global Phenolic Antioxidants Market** 

The global market for phenolic antioxidants is estimated to grow on account of the rising application of antioxidants. Dietary antioxidants may play a significant role in the development and prevention of a variety of disorders linked to oxidative stress. Numerous studies have examined the significance of phenolic compounds as antioxidants in avoiding some of the most common diseases connected to oxidative stress-driven pathologies, such as cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders. 

Moreover, glass, metals, ceramics, and paper have been replaced by plastics as a result of ongoing innovation in the automotive, packaging, building, and construction industries. This innovation has also led to a need for lightweight materials across a number of industries. The products are used in the production of automotive components and also improve the safety of those components. For instance, in the design of automobiles, plastics offer performance and fuel efficiency improvements. Furthermore, components of antioxidants are thermally stable.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global phenolic antioxidants market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Demand for Oil & Gas 
- Boost in Demand for Food & Beverages 

**Challenges:**

Exposure to phenol may occur when using different medications, including throat lozenges and ointments.  Humans experience significant skin, ocular, and mucous membrane irritation with acute (short-term) inhalation or dermal exposure to phenol.  Oral exposure to phenol may be extremely dangerous for people, according to some research.  Anorexia, increased weight loss, diarrhea, vertigo, salivation, dark urine color, effects on the blood and liver, and other symptoms have all been noted in humans who have been chronically (long-term) exposed to these substances. Furthermore, growing environmental awareness and stringent laws and regulations put in place by governments in several European nations, including Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and Austria, are encouraging plastic recyclers to recycle plastic products and support a global trend towards a green and safe environment known as the circular economy. Hence, this factor is also anticipated to hinder the growth of the market. 


By source, the market is segmented into natural and synthetic. Out of these, the synthetic segment is expected to garner the highest revenue backed by expanding use as additives in a variety of end-use industries, including gasoline & lubricant, plastic & rubber, and more. However, the natural segment is also anticipated to rise. Natural antioxidants are compounds found in plants (fruits, legumes, and vegetables), mushrooms, algae, phenolic chemicals, vitamins, and carotenoids. Given this, natural phenolic antioxidants have recently outpaced synthetic ones in popularity. This is mostly owing to consumers' increased need for foods and beverages that are functional, have been infused with natural components, and still keep their original flavor and nutritional content. 

By region, the market in North America for phenolic antioxidants is anticipated to grow over the forecast period. Owing to the government's increasing efforts to raise public awareness of phenolic antioxidants, it is predicted that the market in this area would expand. Moreover, the demand for automobiles is also growing in this region which further boosting demand for plastic in order to produce the light weight vehicles. Hence, this factor is also anticipated to boost the market growth in this region. 

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global phenolic antioxidants market which includes company profiling of DSM, BASF SE, Oxiris Chemicals S. A., Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., Chitec Technology Co., Ltd., Mayzo Inc., Addivant, Double Bond Chemical Ind., Co., Ltd., Kumho Petrochemical, SI Group, Inc., and others.
