**Growing Cases of Sexually Transmitted Diseases to Promote Global Market Share of Urethral Dilators** 

The global urethral dilators market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing sexually transmitted diseases. It is expected that lack of education among the younger generation in low economic regions has led to a rise in sexually transmitted diseases. Urethral strictures can result from sexually transmitted diseases including gonorrhea and chlamydia as they can lead to inflammation and scarring of the urethra which makes it difficult to pass the urine. This could potentially lead to an increase in demand for urethral dilators to stretch the sides of the urethra to restore proper urinary flow.

Currently, there are more than 240 million new cases of STDs occur each year throughout the world.

The global urethral dilators market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing prevalence of kidney stones across the globe. This may result in growing demand for urethral dilators which may be employed to stretch the urethra to help treat urinary obstructions caused by kidney stones 

Globally, more than 1% of persons are said to experience urological stones at some point in their lives.

Furthermore, prevalence of void dysfunction in children may significantly drive market growth for urethral dilators. Voiding issues are quite prevalent in kids which mostly affects over 9% of kids who are 7 years old. This may make it difficult for them to empty their bladder, which necessitates the use of urethral dilators to address the issue.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global urethral dilators market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Elderly Population Globally
- Rising Incidence of Meatal Stenosis

**Challenges:**

The stringent regulations associated with the approval of medical devices including urethral devices are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of urethral dilators. In addition, the presence of other treatment options such as medications and surgical procedures may limit the adoption of urethral dilators.

By end-user, the global urethral dilators market is segmented into ambulatory surgical center, home care settings, hospitals, and clinics. The home care settings segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to the rising popularity of remote patient monitoring. The need for remote patient monitoring equipment such as urethral dilators has significantly increased since remote patient monitoring is now a common technique for managing chronic diseases in seniors. Urethral dilators can be easily used in home settings owing to the availability of advanced dilators and since they cost less as compared to getting the treatment done within hospital premises.

In addition, by usage, the reusable segment is to garner significant revenue as they are cost-effective as compared to the disposable urethral dilators, and are made from high-quality materials. Besides this, reusable urethral dilators are eco-friendly and can be customized according to the patient's needs.

By region, the North America urethral dilators market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by a higher number of people suffering from benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). This as a result may increase the demand for urethral dilators in the region as BPH patients may have an enlarged prostate which may lead to urinary obstruction. 

In addition, the market in Asia Pacific may witness notable revenue owing to the growing elderly population. The chances of urinary incontinence increase with age, which may require the usage of the urethral dilator. Thus leading to an increase in its demand in the region. For instance, India's senior population is anticipated to reach over 190 million in 2031.

Braun Melsungen AG, Guangzhou Weili Medical Equipment Co. Ltd., Manish Medi Innovation, MED pro Medical BV, Medi Globe Technologies GmbH, SEPLOU Inc., Teleflex Inc., and others.
