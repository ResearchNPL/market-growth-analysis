**Rising Focus on Energy Efficiency, Increasing Marine Industry, and Surging Demand for Electric Vehicles to Promote Global Market Share of Synchronous Generator Market**

The global synchronous generator market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased population, industrialization, and urbanization. The synchronous generators are commonly utilized for variable-speed wind turbines. In the year 2023, there will be almost 400, 000 wind turbines all over the world. This is projected to garner remarkable growth during the forecasted period. Other than this, the rising electrification of transportation, including electric vehicles offer various market opportunities. These generators are helpful in meeting the rising demand for electric mobility and aid in making the infrastructure important for charging. It has been estimated that in the year 2023, total number of electric cars in the world will be almost 26.1 million. Hence, the rising demand for electric vehicles augments the growth of the global synchronous generator during the forecasted period. Other than this, with the rising emphasis on renewable energy sources, synchronous generators are important for maintaining the stability of the grid and facilitating the amalgamation of renewable energy sources. The rising need for sustainable energy solutions fuels the market opportunities for the global synchronous generator in the forecasted period. There has been a constant need for an uninterrupted power supply that is fueling the demand for the global synchronous generator market.
