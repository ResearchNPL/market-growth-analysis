The role of grid-scale stationary battery systems is to store energy and release it in the form of electricity when needed. A series of batteries, an electronic control system, an inventor, and a thermal management system are integrated into a grid-scale stationary battery storage system. It is very useful when energy is available at a cheap price or to store electricity when demand is low and use it later when demand is high and electricity prices are high. Therefore, the global grid-scale stationary battery market is expected to grow during the analysis period owing to its power quality control capabilities, successful renewable energy integration, and peak load management of grids. In addition, increasing consumer reliance on low-cost, long-life, and energy storage systems are also advantages, which are expected to offer lucrative opportunities for market growth during the forecast period.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global grid scale stationary battery storage market are:

Growth Drivers:

· Surge in the Need for Power Generation 

· Rising Research Activities in this Domain 

Challenges:

Despite favorable market growth opportunities, the high usage of lead-acid batteries poses potential environmental hazards. Additionally, improper disposal of a single battery creates a large amount of solid waste. Solid waste can have even more negative impacts on the environment if not handled properly. Therefore, adverse environmental impacts are expected to hamper the development of grid-scale stationary storage batteries and, as a result, challenge the market growth during the forecast period. Besides, the high initial investment associated with this market is also expected to limit growth in the upcoming times. These are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of grid scale stationary battery storage.

By battery, the global grid scale stationary battery storage market is segmented into lithium-ion, sodium-sulfur, lead acid, and flow battery. The lithium-ion segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The significant factor behind the growth of this segment is growing awareness about the benefits of lithium-ion such as its low price, durability, zero maintenance, battery life, and others. Additionally, lithium-ion batteries are widely used in electrical products and electronics such as e-vehicles, e-bikes, smartphones, laptops, and others. Moreover, the latest advancement in technologies in lithium-ion batteries is also estimated to drive the growth of this segment in the forecast period.
