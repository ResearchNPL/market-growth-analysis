The global water treatment chemicals market is estimated to occupy a large amount of revenue by growing at a CAGR of ~4% during the forecast period, i.e., 2023 – 2035, owing to the rising demand for chemically treated water from various end user industries such as oil & gas, chemical manufacturing, and power. Along with this, growing adoption of saline water treatment to fulfil increasing water demand, surging urbanization, and decreasing number of freshwater resources are also expected to accelerate the growth of the market in the upcoming years. 

The market is segmented by type and end user. Based on type, the coagulants & flocculants segment is anticipated to occupy the largest share during the forecast period on the back of the increasing use of these chemicals in the tank of chemical products of oil & gas plants. Additionally, by end user, the municipal segment is projected to grab the largest share over the forecast period attributing to the high use of chemicals to treat industrial and municipal wastewater, and growing water scarcity in various regions globally. 

Geographically, the global water treatment chemicals market is segmented into five major regions, namely North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is evaluated to grab a notable share in the market during the forecast period attributing to the growing penetration of water treatment facilities in upstream oil & gas sector in the region. Moreover, the market in Asia Pacific is assessed to witness noteworthy growth and gather the largest share in the future owing to rapid urbanization, and rising requirement for pretreated water in industries in the region. The United Nations stated in one of its reports that the levels of urbanization in Asia were approximately 50 percent in 2018. It is estimated that India and China will be homes to 416 million and 55 million urban dwellers respectively by 2050.

The research is global in nature and covers detailed analysis on the market in North America (U.S., Canada), Europe (U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Belgium, Netherlands & Luxembourg, NORDIC [Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark], Poland, Turkey, Russia, Rest of Europe), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of Latin America), Asia-Pacific (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Rest of Asia-Pacific), Middle East and Africa (Israel, GCC [Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman], North Africa, South Africa, Rest of Middle East and Africa).

**Growing Demand for Chemically Treated Water from End Users Worldwide to Drive Market Growth**

Freshwater resources only account for a small portion of total water resources worldwide, which makes it essential to recycle water for fulfilling the soaring demand. As a result, many industries are moving towards the use of chemically treated wastewater for industrial processes. This in turn is predicted to bolster the market growth significantly in the near future.  

However, availability of alternative water treatment technologies is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of the global water treatment chemicals market over the forecast period.
