Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global rapid influenza diagnostic market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Technological Advances
- Rising Awareness about Rapid Influenza Diagnostic

**Challenges:**

Sensitivity and specificity are the main factors affecting the results of rapid influenza diagnostic kits. The main factor contributing to the complexity of testing is the antigenic diversity of influenza viruses. Final test results may be affected because the sensitivity and specificity of influenza diagnostic tests may vary. Because the rate of false negative results is higher than false positive results, especially during the peak of influenza season, the need for rapid influenza diagnostic tests is somewhat limited. Besides this growing reimbursement challenges and accuracy concerns associated with rapid influenza diagnostics are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of rapid influenza diagnostics.
