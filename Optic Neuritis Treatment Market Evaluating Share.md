The global optic neuritis treatment market is projected to grow at a CAGR of ~5% by attaining a revenue of about USD 300 million during the forecast period, i.e., 2023 – 2035. Factors, such as, booming cases of bacterial infections and the growing prevalence of syphilis are anticipated to propel the growth of the market during the forecast period. For instance, about 1 million individuals died on account of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Additionally, based on the report published by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), about 133,945 cases of syphilis were reported in 2020. 

Furthermore, by end-user, the global optic neuritis treatment market is segmented into ambulatory surgery centers, clinics, hospitals, and others. Out of these sub-segments, the hospitals segment is estimated to obtain a noteworthy share in the market during the forecast period. The growth of the segment can be accounted to the availability of enhanced medical equipment and the presence of trained medical professionals. However, a higher patient pool in the hospitals is also estimated to major growth driver of the market over the forecast period. Around 29% of emergency department visits are observed to be completely unnecessary. 

Furthermore, the global optic neuritis treatment market, by region, is bifurcated into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa region. Out of these regions, the market in the North America region is estimated to grow at a significant pace over the forecast period on the back of escalating adoption of steroids and increasing cases of bacterial infections. Another report published by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that more than 2.8 million individuals are affected by antimicrobial-resistant infections every year solely in the U.S. Such factors are estimated to hike the growth of the market over the forecast period in the region.

Additionally, vision loss caused by nerve damage can occur more frequently in the elderly population than in younger ones.

Therefore, such conditions are anticipated to propel the growth of the market during the forecast period.
