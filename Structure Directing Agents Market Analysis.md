**Growing Expansion of Automotive Industry to Promote Global Market Share of Structure Directing Agents**

The market is exhibiting profitable potential as a result of the industry and automotive sectors' increasing demand for complex materials. During April 2022 and March 2023, the industry produced 2,59,31,867 automobiles, as opposed to 2,30,40,066 units between April 2021 and April 2022. Among these vehicles were passenger cars, trucks, tricycles, and two- and three-wheelers.  Furthermore, new applications have been made possible by the increased efficacy and efficiency of SDAs as a result of developments in material science and technology. There is a particularly high demand for SDAs in the petrochemical, energy, and environmental sectors performance that rely on the synthesis of materials with specific qualities.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global structure directing agents** market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Construction Sector
- Increasing utilization of zeolites

**Challenges:**

Most businesses have invested heavily in keeping their production facilities in the markets where they are now present to sustain growth and development during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic affected product demand throughout the world. The market fell as a result of the lockdown orders that followed and the supply chain interruptions. In addition, consumers are now purchasing laundry products online due to the epidemic, fearing that they could contract the disease from physical establishments. Supply chain interruption and availability of substitutes are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of structure directing agents.

By end use application, the global structure directing agents** market is segmented into zeolite and crystalline materials. The crystalline materials segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Because of its special structure-directing qualities, it is expected that the global market for structure directing agents would benefit from the growing need for a particular structure in crystalline materials. Growth in catalysts is associated with the chemical industry's expansion. In 2021, the worldwide chemical industry brought in approximately 4.7 trillion dollars. Since many catalysts have specific structural requirements, it is expected that growing catalyst industries would lead to an increase in demand for structure-directing agents in the coming years. This makes organic structure guiding agents—agents that can accurately control the growth of crystalline materials—more necessary.

By region, the Europe structure directing agents** market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by strict government rules pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions in this region, as well as a significant supply of detergents and refrigerants.
